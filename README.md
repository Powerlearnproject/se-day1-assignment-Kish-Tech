#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools in the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. 
The importance of software engineering within technology industry is enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power varios aspects of modern life such as communication, healthcare, and entertainment. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering entail the development of programming languages such as C, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in 1970s, and finally the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
Development of programming langauges such as C revolutionized software development by promoting portability, efficiency, and low-level hardware control. in response to software crisis where complex projects suffered from inefficiencies and failures Software Engineering as a discipline was established. Under the discipline, structured development methodologies, quality assurance processes, and lifeclyle management processes were created leading to standardized practises in software design and project management.

Introduction of structured programming in 1970s led to introduction of systematic approach of wwriting code by eliminating the excesive use of GOTO statements. Effective methodologies such as object-oriented programming and competent-based development were implemented. later in 2000s Agile methodologies were implementedin response to the limitations of traditional waterfall models. These methologies focused on flexibiltiy, customer collaboration, and iterative development. It enabled development teams to rapidly adapt to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software solutions more efficiently.  


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Phases of software development life cyle entail requirement gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Requirement gathering phase entails collecting and analyzing user needs, business objects, and system constraints to define project scope. A well-defined requirement specification promotes clarity, reduces ambiguites, and serves as a reference throughout development process. Design phase entails translating requirements into a structured blueprint, defining system architecture, data flow user interfaces, and algorithms.

Implementation phase entails writing the actual code based on design specifications. Developers use programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build system components. Testing promotes software quality, functionality, and performance by identifying and fixing defects. Once tested, the software is deployed to a live environment for user access. Deployment strategies may include phases rollouts, blue-green deployments, and continous delivery. lastly, maintenance phase entails bug fixes, performance optimization, security updates, and feature enhancements based on user feedback. Frequent monitoring and support ensure system realibility, scalability, and adaptability to evolving business needs. 



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies normally follow a linear, sequantial approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. on the other end, Agile methodology is iterative, promoting continous development and feedback through short sprints. 
Waterfall methodology is best suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, such as banking systems and government systems. on the other end, Agile is ideal for dynamic projects requiring frequent updates, like mobile applications.
Under Waterfall methodology, changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, making it rigid and less adaptable to evolving requirements.On the other end, Agile methdology encourages flexibility, promoting continous adjustments based on stakeholder feedback and market changes. 
Under waterfall methodology, customers are only involved in the initial requirement phase and after project completion, leading to potential mismatches of expectations. While under Agile, customers provide ongoing feedback throughout the development phase, ensuring that the final product aligns with their evolving needs. 



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer roles.
Software developers are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
Creating technical documentation and collaborating with cross-functional teams such as, testers and project managers.

Quality Assurance Engineer roles:
They ensure software quality is met by designing and executing test plans. 
Conduting security testing using both manual and automated tools. 
Detecting bugs and defects in softwares leading to release of quality systems.

Project Manager roles
Project manager normally oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. 
Defining project scope, creating timelines, allocating resources, and setting milestones to ensure smooth execution.
Identifying potential risks and implementing mitigation strategies leading to timely delively of projects.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, i.e., Visuo studio and Intellij. They improve  productivity by incorporating features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time error detection. 
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools used for tracking changes in source code and coordinating work among team members. Tools like Git and SVN prevent conflicts, promote team collaboration, and support continous integration. 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges faced by software engineers are changing requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debt. At times requirements may change during development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. To manage this challenge, developers should use Agile methodologies which accomodate changes in the scope. Project managers should set deadlines based on the project scope to avoid unnecessary pressure on developers leading to development of quality systems. Project managers should also regulary reassess the project goals and timelines and communicate effectively to all stakeholders. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing ensures that each module within a software works correctly before integration. it aids in simplifying debugging process, and reducing development costs. Integrationm testing analyzes how various modules within a system interact when combined. it aids in detecting issues in data flow, API communication, and module dependencies. System testing entails assessing the entire software applications' compliance with functional and non-functional requirements. The phase entails performance, security, and usability testing, verifying system reliability before deployment. lastly, acceptance testing validates softwares againts business requirements to determine if they meet user expectations. This phase confirms whether the software is ready for production by identifying usability issues and ensuring overall satisfaction.  



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practise of crafting questions and refining inputs to get reliable responses from AI models. It entails structuring queries, using context, and applying techniques like few-shot learning to guide AI behavior effectively. Prompt engineering enable users to obtain precise, meaningful responses, leading to reduction of ambiguity and misinterpretation. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt is, tell me about technology.

Improved Prompt.
Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnostics and patient care. 
This prompt is more effective as it is clear and specific on the requirements.
